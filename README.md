# PhillySigns
Minimalist inspired theme for video clip galleries - built for Philly Signs project:
* Featured collections are previewed on the home homepage
* For embedding iframes in the gallery - If you add an Item Type Element called "Embedded Video", you can paste in iframes into the element field and it will display alongside other videos in the gallery
* Most video types will display consistently in the gallery views, using an accessible player ([plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr))

### Prerequisites
1. Adding an "Embedded Video" item type element will aid in display of iframes as the main video for an item
